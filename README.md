Let's talk about program:

- Upon opening the training section, you'll be presented with a stack of cards, each representing a different type of program (Gymnastics, Olympic Lifts, Strong - including Squats, Bench Press, Deadlift - Cardio, WOD, AMRAP).

- Swiping a card to the right navigates you to the training section where you can view various subsections like Warm Up, WOD, etc. Swiping a card to the left temporarily removes it from the stack for 10 seconds before it returns.

- In the training section, you can select a subsection to explore a variety of exercises. Tapping on an exercise will take you to a detailed page that includes a description and a video demonstrating how to perform the exercise.

- Additionally, I developed a VideoPicker feature that allows you to save videos using Swift Data.
